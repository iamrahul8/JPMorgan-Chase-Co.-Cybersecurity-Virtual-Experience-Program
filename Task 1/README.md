# **1. Analyze a Large Dataset of Fraud in Financial Payment Services**


### Background information of task:

You have been asked to analyze a recently acquired dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider. Let’s go into a bit more detail about the dataset to set the stage before you get started.

The dataset has five types of transactions:

- CASH-IN is any deposit.
- CASH-OUT is any withdrawal.
- DEBIT is a specific type of withdrawal in which the money is sent to the user’s bank account.
- PAYMENT is the purchase of goods or services. 
- TRANSFER involves moving money from one user’s account to another user’s account.

You will also see two fields related to fraud tagging. IsFlaggedFraud is fraud detected by their automation system while IsFraud is fraud that truly occurred.

Now you have sufficient context to analyze the dataset. Happy exploring!

### Task

- Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
- Explore the financial payment services dataset by completing the querying and data visualization exercises in the Additional Resources below.

We've broken down the steps for you in stages below so you can accomplish this task in an organized manner.

**1. Set Up:**

Before you can tackle any software or development task you need to set up your development environment. Your development environment refers to your system having all the required software installed to modify the code, as well as getting the code of the project itself onto your computer.

To do this we've created a simple guide below on how to get your environment set up: 

**2. Purpose:**

Being able to query and visualize large datasets helps provide critical information for which areas need additional investment. This is not limited to financial systems but internal computer information systems as well.

**3. Acceptance Criteria:**

Using the Pandas library, you learned how to explore and make sense of a dataset. In the process, you wrote queries and then visualized those queries in an easily digestible format that is presentable to management.
